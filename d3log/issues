don't know yet how to get an hddlog without processing the initial
input. right now we call Hddlog::run on all instances, and throw away
the initialization. that's not the correct approach

json_framer is a terrible idea. however, i'd like to do async i/o on
streams of self-framing json objects. serde supports self framed
objects (StreamDeserializer), but since it isn't in async land, it
doesn't look possible to implement io:Read without burning a thread to
block.

is it important that we implement all the methods in
differential_datalog/src/program/update.rs (DeleteKey, etc)?

we are assuming that each scc is evaluated in a given node, but
there isn't anything that stopping us from using a @ within a function
cycle.
